                <p>Where it all started.</p>

            <p class="lp-body-copy">Imagine you’re two hours into a crisp morning ride, gliding along a narrow track with no bodily sensation but the wind on your face. This may sound like a dream if your normal cycling experience includes back pain or backside discomfort. But painless saddles do exist, and the best ones seem to disappear beneath you. They lift you up, conform to your anatomy, and keep you moving forward comfortably. Unfortunately, sometimes finding a saddle that works for your body can be challenging. Specialized introduced Body Geometry to overcome that challenge. And, where Specialized’s research and development leads, the industry follows. It’s true today and it was true when Specialized invented its first Body Geometry design: the Romin saddle.</p>

            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">A Common Ancestor</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Modern bicycle seats trace their heritage to the Romin saddle. Like many American success stories, the Romin’s begins with a big problem, a little ingenuity, and a garage workbench. In 1997, Bicycling Magazine ran a story suggesting traditionally-shaped saddles reduced blood flow and caused sensitive medical issues for riders. After reading the article, an ergonomics physician named Dr. Roger Minkow grabbed a scalpel and started carving up old saddles in his garage, searching for a solution.</p>

            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Learning from Success</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Specialized’s success with the Romin provoked further questions; if modern ergonomics could fix numbness and tingling, could it solve chafing? Saddle sores? Spinal compression? Pedal stroke? Soon, the Body Geometry philosophy guided development across Specialized’s range. Scientifically tested shoes, gloves, clothing, and more, each solving fit issues for everyday cyclists. But even though Body Geometry exploded in popularity, Specialized never stopped reinventing the saddle. The Toupe, Ruby, Phenom, and Sitero joined the Romin atop enthusiasts’ seat posts and pros’ podiums. Each offered a variety of widths and price points matching riders’ various shapes and styles, and each amassed a following of devotees. Still, Specialized did not rest, and their next Body Geometry platform, the Power saddle, surpassed the success of its predecessors.</p>

                <h3>Power</h3>
                <p>Specialized’s Power saddle is revolutionary. Informed by lessons from their women’s and triathlon/TT saddles, the Power’s shape is unlike any saddle preceding it, which is why it set a new industry-wide precedent for comfort. Physicians observed that its short nose and ultra-wide, elongated center channel promote blood flow and sit bone support when its rider moves into aggressive and aero positions, and it’s packed with Body Geometry technologies like MIMIC and Mirror to maximize its utility for diverse users.</p>

                <h3>Mimic</h3>
                <p>MIMIC is the most advanced women’s specific cycling technology on the planet. Designed by Boulder Center for Sports Medicine founder Dr. Andy Pruitt, and tested in laboratory and field settings by 22 cyclists including gravel champion Alison Tetrick, MIMIC’s novel foam padding and contours are tailored to solve fit issues facing female cyclists. If the Power’s cutout doesn’t work for you, try it with MIMIC.</p>

            <p class="lp-body-copy">Have you ever experienced numbness and tingling on a long ride? Or suffered from discomfort, chafing, saddle sores, or swelling? Do you slide forward or backward with each pedal stroke, or feel like you're sitting on a wooden plank? All of these indicate poor saddle fit. Your saddle is the most personalized part of your bicycle, so it should reflect your unique anatomy and performance needs. Visit your local Specialized retailer to help you discover which Body Geometry saddle was engineered for your backside! Retül Technology helps personalize Body Geometry gear to assure you’re riding with more power and less pain.</p>
