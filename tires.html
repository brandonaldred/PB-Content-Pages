            <p class="lp-body-copy">New tires are the most impactful and cost-effective upgrade you can make to your
                bike, and the advent of road tubeless systems and a trend toward wider tires have opened new avenues of
                dependability and speed for road riders. As a result, now is the best time to fit some new shoes to your
                bike. Performance stocks a dizzying array of tires for club rides, criterium racing, commuting, and
                everything in between. How do you choose? Read on to find out!</p>

        <div>
            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Considerations</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Because tires are the only part of your bike in contact with the road, it's
                important to choose the right tire for your riding conditions and surfaces. Your tire's width, casing,
                tread, and weight interact with those conditions to determine the comfort, safety, speed, and longevity
                of your ride. For example, if you plan to ride long distances, then wide tires with slick treads will
                prevent pinch flats and provide a comfortable, smooth ride as the miles add up. Durable casing will
                protect your sidewalls far from home, and tubeless compatibility will provide an additional layer of
                dependability. But, if you want to race a short hill climb where every gram matters, you may want to
                avoid the extra weight from width, thicker casings, and sealant. For more on why your tires' width,
                casing, tread, and weight matter, read on!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Width</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Road cycling has changed. Gone are the days of road bikes equipped with 19mm-wide
                tires inflated to 110psi. Now, even the professional peloton is riding wider and wider tires. Why?
                Because wide tires are more voluminous, and more volume means you can run your tires at a lower pressure
                without fear of pinch flats. Lower pressure translates to a larger contact patch for enhanced traction
                and a plush ride. Combine lower pressure with supple casing, and wider tires will even roll faster than
                their narrow counterparts!<br /><br />Wide tires come with certain tradeoffs. Wider tires are typically
                heavier, and they have a minor aerodynamic penalty compared to narrow tires. If you decide to go wide,
                check your frame's specs for its maximum tire clearance. If you have traditional center-pull brake
                calipers, you will want to make sure your wider tires will clear those, too.</p>

            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Casing</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Your tire's casing plays a crucial role in its durability and ride quality. An easy
                way to learn more about your tire's casing characteristics is to check its threads-per-inch count (TPI).
                TPI affects a tire's durability, suppleness, and weight; higher thread counts are lighter and more
                supple, and lower thread counts are heavier and more durable. Tires with less material in the sidewall
                trade durability for flexibility. Performance recommends a supple casing to smooth out the imperfections
                of a smooth riding surface, or a durable casing if you're hazarding potholes and broken pavement.
                <!-- <br /><br />Casing and bead also determine whether your tires are tubeless compatible. If you're not sure what that means, check out our article, <a href="#">Why Tubeless?</a> -->

        <div>
            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Tread</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Tread is the part of your tire made to contact the ground. It's made of a tough
                rubber compound, and is either smooth or shaped with ridges and grooves. Smooth road tires are sometimes
                called "slicks," and they are ideal for paved surfaces. They roll fast, and their larger contact patch
                offers maximum traction on smooth surfaces. However, on some surfaces you may want to bring a "treaded"
                tire. Their treads are contoured with knobs or grooves, can provide better traction on wet or loose
                surfaces, and are typically more puncture-resistant due to their thickness.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Weight</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Your tire's weight plays an important part in its performance. A heavy tire can feel
                sluggish under acceleration because it requires more force to rotate than a lighter tire. You will
                notice this effect during the repeated hard accelerations of race rides or criteriums, or in the hills
                where weight determines how much energy you must expend to climb. For this reason you will often see
                privateer road racers esteem lightweight "race" tires for events, and heavier "training" tires for
                off-season rides where durability and longevity matter most. However, weight does not always translate
                to durability; inexpensive tires are typically heavier because they are constructed from rudimentary
                compounds that both wear out fast and puncture easily.</p>
