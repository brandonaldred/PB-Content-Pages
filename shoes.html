                exclusive Body Geometry technologies like the Longitudinal Arch, Varus Wedge, and Metatarsal Button on your
                personalized insoles, Specialized’s shoes keep you comfortable, injury-free, and ready to put down power no
                matter the road ahead or the miles behind.

            <h3 class="lp-body-copy-title">Always Forward</h3>
            <p class="lp-body-copy">Body Geometry shoes are the brainchild of Boulder Center for Sports Medicine founder Dr. Andy Pruitt. While at Boulder, Dr. Pruitt pioneered biomechanical alignment protocols to fit cyclists to their bicycles. He is widely credited as one of the first people to consider bike fitting from both a front-on, and side-on, approach. By adding medial and lateral measurements to standard fore and aft calculations, Dr. Pruitt discovered the importance of correct arch support and foot positioning for a healthy and powerful pedal stroke. Working with Specialized’s engineers and athletes since 1999, Dr. Pruitt applied his observations into the design of every Body Geometry shoe in the form of the Longitudinal Arch, Varus Wedge, and Metatarsal Button. This triad of shoe technologies combine to align the hip, foot, and knee, while limiting lateral knee movement and promoting good circulation from hip to toe, thereby reducing the need for knee surgeries among cyclists to “nearly zero.” That’s good news for everybody, from the college commuter to the weekend warrior to the podium chaser.</p>

            <p class="lp-body-copy">Specialized is the only manufacturer in the world with Body Geometry. Put their shoes on your feet, throw your leg over the saddle, and feel the difference.</p>

                <p class="lp-column-title">Longitudinal Arch</p>
                <p>A patented, molded arch built into the outsole which is paired with one of three standard footbed shapes personalized to your arch height to prevent your arches from collapsing and wasting power.

                <p>A 1.5mm built-in wedge stabilizes your forefoot’s movement and improve your knee alignment to increase power output, lengthen your time to exhaustion, and minimize overuse injuries.

                <p>A gentle rising and lifting of your forefoot separates the bones to reduce pressure on nearby nerves and arteries. Better blood flow, better feeling, no matter the temperature outside.
